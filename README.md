# 🚢 Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project performs a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Titanic dataset or similar population-based dataset. The primary goal is to understand the structure and distribution of demographic features such as **age**, **gender**, and **survival rate** (if applicable) using Python data visualization libraries.
